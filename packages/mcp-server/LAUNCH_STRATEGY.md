Title: I built an AI testing assistant that works with ANY IDE (VS Code, Cursor, Claude, etc.)

Hey r/programming! 👋

I've been frustrated with flaky E2E tests for years. So I built AutoQA - an AI-powered testing assistant that:

✅ Generates tests from natural language
✅ Self-heals when selectors break
✅ Analyzes failures with AI
✅ Works with ANY IDE via MCP protocol

It's open source and works with:
- VS Code
- Cursor
- Claude Desktop
- Any MCP-compatible tool

Would love your feedback!

### Hacker News Post

```
Show HN: AutoQA – AI Testing Assistant for Any IDE

Hi HN! I built AutoQA to solve the pain of maintaining E2E tests.

Key features:
- Natural language → Playwright code
- Self-healing when UI changes
- AI-powered root cause analysis
- Visual regression testing
- Works with VS Code, Cursor, Claude, etc.

It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so it's IDE-agnostic. The core is open source (MIT).

GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]

Happy to answer questions!
